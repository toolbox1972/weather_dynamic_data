**Weather report**

The weather per day is stored in a javascript list.
That list is being used as reference to dynamically inject the correct picture into HTML image tag.
The source picture reference for each day is constructed as a merged string.

Plan is at later stage to incorporate an API that will fetch real
weather data and let the app resolve the mapping to illustrate correct icon.
